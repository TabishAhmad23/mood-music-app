## Production Deployment

1. Set up a production environment:
   - Use HTTPS
   - Set appropriate CORS origins
   - Configure proper session settings
   - Set up rate limiting

2. Update environment variables:
   - Use production Spotify credentials
   - Set secure secret keys
   - Configure production API URLs

3. Build frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

4. Deploy backend:
   - Use a production-grade ASGI server (e.g., uvicorn with gunicorn)
   - Set up proper logging
   - Configure SSL/TLS

## Security Considerations

- All API endpoints are rate-limited
- Sessions are managed securely with HTTP-only cookies
- CORS is configured for specific origins
- Security headers are implemented
- Input validation is in place
- Token refresh is handled automatically
